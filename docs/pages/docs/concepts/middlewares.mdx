# Middlewares

A middleware is a function that operates between an incoming request and the corresponding outgoing response. It serves as a processing layer before or after an endpoint handler, carrying out tasks like logging, authentication, and other sorts of data manipulation.

Middlewares in `zhttp` are essentially just express middlewares, with two extra properties: their type ([indicating when to run them](../order-of-execution)), and an optional name.
Middlewares can be bound on multiple levels:
- The server
- A controller
- An endpoint

## Basic middleware example

```ts
// ../../../../examples/concept-middleware.ts

import { type Request, type Response, type NextFunction } from 'express'
import { middleware, MiddlewareTypes } from '@zhttp/core'

export const lastVisitMiddleware = middleware({
  name: 'lastVisitMiddleware',
  type: MiddlewareTypes.BEFORE,
  handler (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const now = new Date()
    const lastVisitCookieValue = req.cookies.beenHereBefore
    const lastVisitTime = lastVisitCookieValue != null ? new Date(String(lastVisitCookieValue)) : undefined
    res.cookie('beenHereBefore', now.toISOString())
    if (lastVisitTime == null) {
      console.log('Seems like we\'ve got a new user ðŸ‘€')
      next(); return
    }
    const daysSinceLastVisit = (now.getTime() - lastVisitTime.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
    console.log(`It's been ${daysSinceLastVisit} days since this user last visited.`)
    next()
  }
})

```
