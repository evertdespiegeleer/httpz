# Endpoints

Endpoints are the building blocks of your API. They define the HTTP methods, paths, inputs, outputs, and behavior for each API call.
As can be seen in the example below, endpoints are defined using a function chaining approach.
These functions are further refered to as 'modulators'.

## Handlers and input/output typing

Endpoint handlers are similar to plain express handlers, with some extra feastures for strict input and output typing. Rather than the typical 2 express handler parameters (`request` and `response`), there's three: `inputs`, `request`, `response`.
`inputs` is a typed object containing everything defined in the input schema. `request` and `response` are simply the express `request` and `response` objects.

Sending out a response is as simle as returning a value in the handler function. Handler responses, just like inputs, are strictly typed. When an output schema is specified and the handler function doesn't return a value that corresponds to said schema, typescript will comlain.

By default, every endpoint will send its response with a `application/json` content type. This is typial for APIs, but there might be exceptions. You can override this content type using the `responseContentType` modulator.

### Using req/res directly

You _can_ take input via the `request` object and use the `response` object to send a response in typical express manner, so migrating from express should be fairly trivial.
However, beware that where you do this, you'll lose:
- strict typing
- output validation
- AFTER-type middlewares

## Routing
An important distinction between plain express and zhttp is that zhttp – consciously – doesn't really support routing. The paths you see in your endpoint definitions are the paths that can be called; No hidden prefixes.

## Basic endpoint example

```ts
// ../../../../examples/concept-endpoint.ts

import { z } from 'zod'
import { endpoint, get } from '@zhttp/core'

const zGreetingOutput = z.object({
  message: z.string()
})

const zGreetingInput = {
  query: z.object({
    name: z.string().optional()
  })
}

// ⬇ For common http methods (get, post, put, del), utility functions are available:
get('/hello', 'getGreeting')
  .description('Say hello to everyone')
  .input(zGreetingInput)
  .response(zGreetingOutput)
  .handler(async ({ query }) => {
    return {
      message: `Hello ${query.name ?? 'everyone'}!`
    }
  })

// `endpoint` is a generic function which supports every http method.
endpoint('get', '/goodbye', 'getGoodbye')
  .description('Say goodbye to everyone')
  .input(zGreetingInput)
  .response(zGreetingOutput)
  .handler(async ({ query }) => {
    return {
      message: `Goodbye ${query.name ?? 'everyone'}!`
    }
  })

```
