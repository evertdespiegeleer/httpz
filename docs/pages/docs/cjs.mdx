# CommonJS support

[ðŸ“° CommonJS is hurting JavaScript](https://deno.com/blog/commonjs-is-hurting-javascript)

The JavaScript ecosystem is (slowly but steadily) moving towards ESM and away from CommonJS. zhttp is build as an ESM module. It's strongly encouraged to use it like that.

CommonJS is currently supported; the packages include both builds for ESM and CommonJS. You can use zhttp both ways.

If major issues with supporting CommonJS were to come up, or if we'd notice that the package would become too big (by essentially having to ship the build code twice), CommonJS support might be dropped in the future.
