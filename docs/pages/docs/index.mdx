# Introduction

zhttp is a minimal, typesafe, [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) compatible HTTP library. It's build around [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod).

It solves some of the major pains of building an API with express (handler typing, error handling, input/output validation, openapi...) while attempting to stay as flexible (read: _as close to plain express_) as possible.
